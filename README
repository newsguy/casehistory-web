This serves as a frontend for the CaseHistory application. This one is implemented using Apache Wicket framework. We could switch over to Ruby on Rails or other web frameworks later as deemed necessary.

This is also a maven project. To build and run this: mvn jetty:run
After running, the frontend should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/casehistory-web/app
